# 3DText
Testing normal text rendering in WebGL
(maybe should have named this WebGLText)

Contents:
#spritesheet.html:
- Currently most advanced text rendering system
- Packs many words into textures and renders portions of each texture


#3DText.html:
- First attempt rendering words with webgl


#traslationtest.html:
- First animated program


#fpstest.html:
- General WebGL feature testing program
- Not directly related to text rendering
- Use mouse to add points to the webgl array
    (click 3 different spots to see a triangle)
- Use controls to alter how those points are rendered
- Maybe learn a bit about webgl


#TextClass.html:
- First attempt at making my text rendering system more object oriented
- Has some controls as well
